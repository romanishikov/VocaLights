# Overview
VocaLights is the expanding program that takes voice input and registers commands to adjust lighting in various ways. <strong>Note: This requires smart light bulbs in order to function as intended. </strong><br>

***Tested and validated with LifX and Philips Hue model light bulbs and working on expanding to as many others as are available.***

# Usage
You may choose to run the main script in the background and go on through the day. So long as a microphone is within distance, simply speak the desired command and the lights will turn on and off, dim and brighten, change colors, and set the mood for the space of your choice.<br></br>
